## Deployment via Docker

This section describes how to build, start, and manage the application's Docker containers.

### Build and Start Containers

Run the following command to build the images (if needed) and start all services in detached mode:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

### Check Container Status

To verify the container's state:

```sh
docker ps -a
```


This will list all containers, including those that have exited.

### Start Services (if already built)

If the containers have already been created (from a previous build), simply start them again with:

```sh
docker start $(docker ps -aq)
```
### Stop All Running Containers

To stop all currently running containers:

```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```
